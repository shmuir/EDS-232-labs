#### Data Cleaning

Today, we are going to use the top 3 habitats and take a random sample of 500, then select trophic level and length for clustering

```{r}

fish_clean = read_csv(here("week-2", "fish_clean.csv")) %>% 
  mutate(habitat = as.factor(habitat)) %>% 
  filter(habitat %in% c("reef-associated", "demersal", "benthopelagic")) %>% 
  sample_n(500)

fish_clust = fish_clean %>% 
  select(trophic_level_impute, length_impute) 

lapply(fish_clust, class)

```

### Clustering

```{r}
folds <- vfold_cv(fish_clust, v = 5)
```

#### KMeans

```{r}
kmeans_spec <- k_means(num_clusters = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("stats")
```

```{r}
recipe <- recipe(~., data = fish_clust) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())

kmean_wf <- workflow(recipe, kmeans_spec)
```

```{r}
clust_num_grid <- grid_regular(num_clusters(),
                               levels = 10)
```

```{r}
res <- tune_cluster(
  kmean_wf,
  resamples = folds,
  grid = clust_num_grid,
  control = control_grid(save_pred = TRUE, extract = identity),
  metrics = cluster_metric_set(sse_within_total, sse_total, sse_ratio)
)
```

```{r}
res_metrics <- res %>%
  collect_metrics()
res_metrics
```

```{r}
res_metrics %>%
  filter(.metric == "sse_ratio") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = num_clusters, y = mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("mean WSS/TSS ratio, over 5 folds") +
  xlab("Number of clusters") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:10)
```

```{r}
kmeans_spec1 <- k_means(num_clusters = 4) %>%
  set_engine("stats")

kmean_wf1 <- workflow(recipe, kmeans_spec1)
```

```{r}
kmeans_fit1 <- kmean_wf1 %>%
  fit(data = fish_clust)
kmeans_fit1 # mean of the cluster center; clustering vector;  within cluster SS by cluster
# in this case cluster 3 is the most diverse cluster (124.7); want the percentage to be higher for between cluster variance
```

```{r}
kmeans_spec2 <- k_means(num_clusters = 5) %>%
  set_engine("stats")

kmean_wf2 <- workflow(recipe, kmeans_spec2)
```

```{r}
kmeans_fit2 <- kmean_wf2 %>%
  fit(data = fish_clust)
kmeans_fit2 # mean of the cluster center; clustering vector;  within cluster SS by cluster
# in this case cluster 3 is the most diverse cluster (124.7); want the percentage to be higher for between cluster variance
```

```{r}
kmeans_fit1 %>%
  silhouette_avg(fish_clust) # check validity and consistency within clusters of data; want higher value
# when decreasing dimensionality of data, it's hard to get high values
```

```{r}
kmeans_fit2 %>%
  silhouette_avg(fish_clust)
```

```{r}
# going to use fit 1 bc it had a higher silhouette
clusters <- kmeans_fit1 %>%
  extract_cluster_assignment()

# add cluster to df
fish_clean$cluster <- clusters$.cluster
```

```{r}
ggplot(fish_clean) +
  geom_point(aes(trophic_level_impute, length_impute, color = cluster)) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_colour_viridis_d()
```
- most division between trophic levels
- at highest trophic level here, we see division between length as well

#### Heirarchical Clustering

```{r}
hc_spec <- hier_clust(linkage_method = "average")
```

```{r}
hc_fit <- hc_spec %>%
  fit(~., data = fish_clean)
```

```{r}
hc_fit$fit %>% plot()
```
