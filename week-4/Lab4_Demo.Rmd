Let's explore how employee income and overtime hours worked affect likelihood of employee attrition.  Any predictions?

```{r}
# read in data
data("attrition", package = "modeldata")

df <- attrition %>% mutate_if(is.ordered, factor, ordered = FALSE)

# Create training (70%) and test (30%) sets for the 
set.seed(123)  # for reproducibility 
churn_split <- initial_split(df, prop = 0.7)
churn_train <- training(churn_split)
churn_test  <- testing(churn_split)
```

Let's set up set up our recipes now for pre-processing. 
```{r recipe}
#specify and prep recipe
churn_rec <- recipe(Attrition~., data = churn_train) %>%
  step_integer(Attrition, zero_based = TRUE) %>%
  prep(churn_train)

#bake recipe with training data
churn_baked_train <- bake(churn_rec, new_data = churn_train)
```


```{r specify_models_glm}
#MonthlyIncome
model_inc <- glm(Attrition ~ MonthlyIncome, data = churn_baked_train, family = "binomial")

#OverTime
model_time <- glm( Attrition ~ OverTime, data = churn_baked_train, family = "binomial")
```


```{r tidy_model_objs}
broom::tidy(model_inc)
broom::tidy(model_time)
```

```{r exp_coefs}
#exponentiate the coefficients from model objects for interpretation. Gives us changes in odds of attrition
exp(coef(model_inc))
exp(coef(model_time))
```

- For each dollar they make the odds of them leaving is increases multiplicitivly by 0.999 (decreasing overall)
- If they worked over time the odds of them leaving multiply by 3.5 times 

```{r recode_attrition_test}
churn_baked_test <- bake(churn_rec, new_data = churn_test)
```

```{r plot_income_attrition}
ggplot(churn_baked_test, aes(x = MonthlyIncome, y = Attrition)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "glm", 
              method.args = list(family = "binomial"))
```
- Losing fewer employees than they're retaining


We can add more predictors, creating a multiple logistic regression model

```{r mult_log_regression}
model_both <- glm(Attrition ~ MonthlyIncome + OverTime, family = "binomial", data = churn_train)
tidy(model_both)
```

```{r}
ggplot(churn_baked_test, aes(x = MonthlyIncome, y = Attrition, color = OverTime)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  stat_smooth(method = "glm", se = FALSE, method.args = list(family = "binomial"))
```

- the lines are what we are expecting the models to look like
