### Data Introduction

This data was acquired form FishBase (Froese and Pauley 2000) using the rfishbase package (Boettiger et al., 2012; see data_acquisition.R for data retrieval). 

The data set includes the following variables:

* `species`: the scientific name of fish 
* `genus`: the scientific genus of fish
* `common_name`: common name used for fish
* `body_shape`**: shape of fish body (elongated, fusiform/normal, eel-like, short and/or deep, other)**
* `habitat`**: area of the ocean that fish typically resides in **
* `depth_range_shallow`**: minimum depth fish is found**
* `depth_range_deep`**: maximum depth fish is found**
* `vulnerability`**: metric for how at risk a fish is to over fishing based on other life history and ecological traits**
* `length`**: total length, fork length, or standard length of fish**
* `trophic_level`**: trophic level that the fish occupies based on position in food web **
* `food_troph`: trophic level that fish's food source occupies
* `food`**: type of food source fish consumes **
* `family`: the scientific family of fish

*Bold variables are included in the models. A full copy of the codebook is included in the data/raw folder*

#### Habitat Types 

This project attempts to predict 8 different habitat types. These habitats are described below to note differences.

1. pelagic: living within several regions of the pelagic zone, through both shallower pelagic-oceanic and deeper bathypelagic
2. pelagic-neritic: relating to upper layers of the ocean on the continental shelf. Waters here are not as deep as the pelagic zone
3. reef-associated: living in association with a coral reef. This habitat is the most diverse, offering an array of food types and shelters
4. demersal: relating to living on or near the ocean floor, whether in the pelagic-neritic, pelagic, or bathypelagic zones   
5. benthopelagic: relating specifically to the ocean floor in the pelagic zone, but not at the deepest depths
6. bathydemersal: relating to the ocean floor at depths greater than 200 meters
7. pelagic-oceanic: relating specifically to the upper layers of the open ocean. Food is scarce
8. bathypelagic: relating to deeper layers of the open ocean at the continental slope. Limited sunlight reaches this zone

While there is some possible overlap in these categories, they are kept separate as specifically defined in FishBase. Data has already been pre-processed for you. 

#### Data Cleaning

We are going to load the data and only use two categories (demersal - i.e., bottom dwelling species - and reef-associated).

Additionally, we are going to binary encode these values. This means turning them into a 0 and 1. 

```{r}

fish_clean = read_csv(here("discussion", "data", "fish_clean.csv")) %>% 
  filter(habitat == "demersal" | habitat == "reef-associated") %>% 
  mutate(habitat = case_when(
    habitat == "demersal" ~ 0,
    habitat == "reef-associated" ~ 1,
  )) %>% 
  mutate(habitat = as.factor(habitat))

```

### Modeling

Today, we will look at preforming logistic regression on this data set. We will continue to come back to this data set as we learn more models in this section.

#### Training and Testing Data Creation

Here, we will use functions from the `rsample` package within `TidyModels`

```{r}
data_split = initial_split(fish_clean, prop = .8, strata = habitat) #split data stratified by survived

train = training(data_split) #get training data
test = testing(data_split) #get testing data

head(train)
head(test)
```

#### Recipe Creation

After splitting my data, the first step is to create a recipe indicating the formula for the model and any pre-processing steps I want to preform on my data. Here we will use the `recipes` package.

I will be predicting habitat based on trophic level, length, minimum depth, maximum depth, vulnerability, body shape, and food source type. We will be normalizing all numeric predictors

```{r}
fish_recipe = recipe(habitat ~ shape_impute + food_impute + shallow_impute + deep_impute + vulnerability + length_impute + trophic_level_impute, data = train) %>% #create model recipe
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) #normalize all numeric predictors
```

#### Model 2: Logistic Regression

```{r}
?logistic_reg
```

```{r}
log_model = logistic_reg() %>% #set logistic regression model
  set_engine("glm") %>% #use glm engine
  set_mode("classification") #set classification as mode
```


```{r}
log_workflow = workflow() %>% #create workflow
  add_model(log_model) %>% #add logisitic regression model
  add_recipe(fish_recipe) #add recipe

log_workflow
```

#### Model Fitting

```{r, eval = FALSE}
train_fit = fit(log_workflow, train) #fit the boosted tree model to the training set

train_fit
```

```{r}
train_predict = predict(object = train_fit, new_data = train) %>% #predict the training set
  bind_cols(train) #bind training set column to prediction

train_predict2 = predict(object = train_fit, new_data = train, type = "prob") %>% #predict the training set
  bind_cols(train) #bind training set column to prediction
```

```{r}
test_predict = predict(train_fit, test) %>% #get prediction probabilities for test 
  bind_cols(test)  #bind to testing column

test_predict2 = predict(train_fit, test, type ="prob") %>% #get prediction probabilities for test 
  bind_cols(test)  #bind to testing column

head(test_predict)
head(test_predict2)
```

#### Model Metrics and Evaluation

```{r}
accuracy(train_predict, truth = habitat, estimate = .pred_class) #get training accuracy

sensitivity(train_predict, truth = habitat, estimate = .pred_class)
specificity(train_predict, truth = habitat, estimate = .pred_class)

train_roc_auc = roc_curve(train_predict2, habitat, .pred_0)
autoplot(train_roc_auc)
```

```{r}
test_predict = predict(train_fit, test) %>% #get prediction probabilities for test 
  bind_cols(test) #bind to testing column

test_predict2 = predict(train_fit, test, type = "prob") %>% #get testing prediction
  bind_cols(test) #bind to testing column
```

```{r}
accuracy(test_predict, truth = habitat, estimate = .pred_class) #get accuracy of testing prediction

sensitivity(test_predict, truth = habitat, estimate = .pred_class)
specificity(test_predict, truth = habitat, estimate = .pred_class)

test_roc_auc = roc_curve(test_predict2, habitat, .pred_0)
```

#### Visualizations

```{r, fig.cap="Figure 24. confusion matrix displaying results of the best model: the boosted tree model"}
test_predict %>% 
  conf_mat(truth = habitat, estimate = .pred_class) %>% #create confusion matrix
  autoplot(type = "heatmap") + #plot confusion matrix with heatmap
  theme_bw() + #change theme
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust=1)) #rotate axis labels

autoplot(test_roc_auc)
```
